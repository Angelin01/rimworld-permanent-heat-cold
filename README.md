# Rimworld mod - Permanent Heat and Cold

Enables choosing heat wave and cold snap as starting permanent scenario conditions.

This mod is an update of the [Permanent Heat Wave and Cold Snap mod by J E B U S](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2082630219), but instead of redefining the entire HeatWave and ColdSnap defs, simply patches them.

To enable a permanent heat wave or cold snap when creating your new game simply go to Scenario Editor -> Edit Mode -> Add Part -> Permanent Map Condition -> Heat Wave / Cold Snap
